## Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser

**CRITICAL - loads new code with better error logging!**

**Windows/Linux:** Ctrl + Shift + R  
**Mac:** Cmd + Shift + R

## Step 2: Check Console

**After hard refresh, look for these messages:**

```
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
[PWA] üöÄ STARTING PWA INIT - SERVICE WORKER V8
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
[PWA] STEP 1/3: Generating PWA icons...
[PWA] ‚úÖ STEP 1 COMPLETE: Icons ready
[PWA] STEP 2/3: Registering service worker...
[PWA] ‚ÑπÔ∏è Using /public/service-worker.js (cache-first strategy)
[PWA] Attempting to register /service-worker.js...
```

**Then you'll see EITHER:**

### ‚úÖ Success Path:
```
[PWA] ‚úÖ Registration successful!
[PWA] Scope: https://...
[ServiceWorker] ‚ö° Loading service worker V8 (cache-first)...
[ServiceWorker] ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing V8...
[ServiceWorker] Cache opened
[ServiceWorker] ‚úÖ Activating V8...
[PWA] ‚úÖ Service worker is ready!
[PWA] ‚úÖ STEP 2 COMPLETE: Service worker is controlling the page!
[PWA] ‚úÖ App is now available OFFLINE!
```

**If you see this** ‚Üí Success! Continue to Step 3.

### ‚ùå Failure Path:
```
[PWA] ‚ùå Service worker registration FAILED:
[PWA] Error: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope...
[PWA] Message: The script has an unsupported MIME type ('text/html')
```

OR:

```
[PWA] ‚ùå Service worker registration FAILED:
[PWA] Error: Failed to register a ServiceWorker...
[PWA] Message: A bad HTTP response code (404) was received...
```

**If you see this** ‚Üí File doesn't exist or wrong type. See Step 2b.

---

## Step 2b: If Registration Failed

### Check if file exists:

**Visit this URL in a NEW TAB:**
```
https://retain-daisy-60193763.figma.site/service-worker.js
```

**What do you see?**

**A) JavaScript code starting with:**
```javascript
// Service Worker for Rocket Engine Thrust Monitor PWA
const CACHE_NAME = 'thrust-monitor-v8';
```
‚Üí **File EXISTS!** Problem is with MIME type or registration. Tell me this.

**B) 404 error or "Not Found":**
‚Üí **File MISSING!** Figma Make isn't serving `/public` files. Tell me this.

**C) HTML page (same as main page):**
‚Üí **Wrong content!** Server returning HTML instead of JS. Tell me this.

---

## Step 3: If Registration Succeeded

**Wait 10 seconds**, then run:

```javascript
offline.diagnostic()
```

Should show:
```
‚úÖ PWA is ready for offline mode!
```

---

## Step 4: Test Offline

1. F12 ‚Üí Network ‚Üí "Offline" ‚Üí Reload
2. Should load with orange banner! ‚úÖ

---

## üÜò What to Tell Me

**Copy/paste from console:**

1. **The error message** (if registration failed)
2. **What you see** when you visit `/service-worker.js` directly

**Example:**
```
Registration failed with:
"Failed to register a ServiceWorker: A bad HTTP response code (404)"

When I visit /service-worker.js I see: 404 Not Found
```

---

## üí° Quick Debug

**Run this in console to test manually:**

```javascript
// Test if service worker registration works at all
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', {
  scope: '/',
  updateViaCache: 'none'
}).then(reg => {
  console.log('‚úÖ Direct registration worked!', reg);
}).catch(err => {
  console.error('‚ùå Direct registration failed:', err.message);
});
```

---

**DO THIS NOW:**
1. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Check console** for success or failure
3. **Tell me** what error you see (if any)
4. **Visit** `/service-worker.js` and tell me what you see
