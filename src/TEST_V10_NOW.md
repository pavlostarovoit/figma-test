# 🎯 TEST V10 NOW - Fixed File Path!

## 🔑 The Fix

**Your working project uses:** `/public/sw.js`  
**I was trying to use:** `/public/service-worker.js` ❌

**NOW FIXED:** Using `/sw.js` just like your working project! ✅

---

## 🚀 TEST IMMEDIATELY

### Step 1: Hard Refresh (CRITICAL!)

**Must reload the new code:**

- **Windows/Linux:** Ctrl + Shift + R
- **Mac:** Cmd + Shift + R

---

### Step 2: Check Console

**Look for V10:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
[PWA] 🚀 STARTING PWA INIT - SERVICE WORKER V10
═══════════════════════════════════════
[PWA] STEP 2/3: Registering service worker...
[PWA] ℹ️ Using /sw.js (network-first, v10)
[PWA] Attempting to register /sw.js...
```

**Then either:**

### ✅ SUCCESS:
```
[PWA] ✅ Registration successful!
[ServiceWorker] Loading v10...
[ServiceWorker] Installing v10...
[ServiceWorker] Cache opened
[ServiceWorker] Installation complete
[ServiceWorker] Activating v10...
[ServiceWorker] Activated successfully
[ServiceWorker] Service worker v10 ready!
[PWA] ✅ Service worker is ready!
[PWA] ✅ STEP 2 COMPLETE: Service worker is controlling the page!
[PWA] ✅ App is now available OFFLINE!
```

**🎉 IT WORKS!**

### ❌ FAILURE:
```
[PWA] ❌ Service worker registration FAILED:
```

**Copy the exact error and tell me.**

---

### Step 3: Verify File Serves

**Open in new tab:**
```
https://retain-daisy-60193763.figma.site/sw.js
```

**OR (in preview):**
```
https://5fe8197c-9794-43e9-972e-89310f225abc-figmaiframepreview.figma.site/sw.js
```

**What you should see:**

```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = 'thrust-monitor-v10';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  '/styles/globals.css'
];

console.log('[ServiceWorker] Loading v10...');
// ... rest of JavaScript code
```

✅ **If you see this:** File is served! SW should work!

❌ **If you see 404 or app UI:** File not served (Figma Make issue)

---

### Step 4: Test Offline (If Registration Works)

**Wait 10 seconds after registration**, then:

1. **F12** → Open DevTools
2. **Network** tab
3. **Dropdown** at top → Select **"Offline"**
4. **Reload** page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

**Expected result:**
- ✅ Page loads from cache
- ✅ Orange banner: "📱 Running offline from cache"
- ✅ UI works (no live data from 192.168.4.1)
- ✅ Console shows: `[ServiceWorker] Network failed, using cache`

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### V9 (Broken)
```javascript
// Tried to register wrong file
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
// File: /public/service-worker.js
// Result: 404 ❌
```

### V10 (Fixed)
```javascript
// Now using correct file (like your working project)
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
// File: /public/sw.js
// Result: Should work! ✅
```

---

## 💡 Why This Should Work

**Your working Figma Make project:**
- Uses `/public/sw.js` ✅
- Figma Make serves it correctly ✅
- Service worker registers ✅
- PWA works ✅

**This project (V10):**
- NOW uses `/public/sw.js` ✅ (same as yours)
- Same file name ✅
- Same location ✅
- Same code ✅
- Should work exactly like your project! ✅

---

## 🔧 Debug Commands

**If registration succeeds, test with:**

```javascript
// Check if service worker is active
offline.checkServiceWorker()

// Check what's in cache
offline.checkCache()

// Full diagnostic
offline.diagnostic()

// Force clear and re-register
offline.clearAndReload()
```

---

## 📋 What to Report

### If It Works ✅

**Tell me:**
1. ✅ "V10 registered successfully!"
2. "Console shows service worker v10 messages"
3. "Offline mode works!"
4. 🎉 **PWA IS READY!**

### If It Fails ❌

**Tell me:**
1. ❌ The exact error message
2. What `/sw.js` shows when you visit it
3. Any other console errors

---

## 🚀 DO THIS NOW

1. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check console** for "V10"
3. **Look for** success or error messages
4. **Test** visiting `/sw.js` in browser
5. **Report** results!

**This should work because it's using the EXACT same path as your working project!** 🎯

---

**HARD REFRESH NOW!** The file path is fixed! 🚀
