## 📖 Understanding the Limitation

### Why Service Worker Doesn't Work in Preview

**Figma Make Preview:**
- Routes **all URLs** to your React app
- Does **not serve** static files from `/public`
- When you visit `/service-worker.js` → Shows app UI ❌
- This is how preview works - not a bug!

**Service Worker Requirements:**
- Must be registered from **real HTTPS URL**
- Cannot use blob:, data:, or inline URLs
- Browser security - cannot be bypassed

**Result:**
- Preview = No service worker
- Published = Service worker works! ✅

### What This Means for You

**Preview is for:**
- ✅ UI/UX development
- ✅ Testing API integration
- ✅ Testing layouts on mobile
- ✅ Testing camera controls
- ✅ 99% of development work

**Published is for:**
- ✅ Testing offline mode
- ✅ Testing PWA installation
- ✅ Final testing before deployment
- ✅ Showing to users

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Service Worker (V8)

**Located:** `/public/service-worker.js`

**Strategy:** Cache-first
- Checks cache first (instant!)
- Falls back to network
- Updates cache in background
- Works great offline

**Features:**
- Automatic caching of all assets
- Offline fallback for navigation
- Never caches API requests (192.168.4.1)
- Cleans up old caches automatically

### PWA Manifest

**Generated dynamically** with:
- App name: "Rocket Thrust Monitor"
- Icons: 192x192 and 512x512
- Display: Standalone (fullscreen)
- Theme color: Rocket orange
- Orientation: Portrait-primary

### Design System

**All components use:**
- Typography: Noto Sans variable font
- Colors: CSS custom properties
- Spacing: Design system tokens
- Borders: Consistent radius variables

## 📋 File Structure

```
/public/service-worker.js       ← Service worker (V8)
/utils/pwaIcons.ts              ← Icon generation
/utils/offlineDebug.ts          ← Console testing tools
/components/OfflineIndicator.tsx ← Orange offline banner
/App.tsx                        ← PWA initialization
/styles/globals.css             ← Design system tokens
```

---

## 🔧 Console Commands

**Available in preview AND published:**

```javascript
// Check PWA status
offline.diagnostic()

// Check what's cached
offline.checkCache()

// Check service worker
offline.checkServiceWorker()

// Clear everything and reload
offline.clearAll()

// Show all commands
offline.help()
```

---

## 🎨 Design System Compliance

All generated UI follows your design system:

**Typography:**
- Font: Noto Sans (variable weights)
- Sizes: CSS custom properties
- Weights: Design system tokens

**Colors:**
- Primary: Rocket orange (#ff9900)
- States: Color-coded (STANDBY=green, CALIB=blue, TEST=orange, ERROR=red)
- Backgrounds: System grays

**Spacing:**
- Gap: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px
- Padding: Design system values
- Borders: 1px, 2px with radius

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### In Preview

**If you see errors:**
```
[PWA] ❌ Service worker registration FAILED
```

**This is expected!** Preview doesn't serve static files.

**What to do:**
- ✅ Ignore the error (app still works)
- ✅ Continue development
- ✅ Test other features
- ✅ Publish when ready to test PWA

### After Publishing

**If service worker still fails:**

1. **Check file is served:**
   - Visit: `/service-worker.js`
   - Should see code, not UI

2. **Hard refresh browser:**
   - Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

3. **Check console:**
   - Look for V8 messages
   - Check for errors

4. **Clear cache:**
   ```javascript
   offline.clearAll()
   ```
