# Test Service Worker File Access

## Quick Check

**Open this URL in your browser:**

```
https://retain-daisy-60193763.figma.site/service-worker.js
```

### ‚úÖ If you see code:
The file looks like this:
```javascript
// Service Worker for Rocket Engine Thrust Monitor PWA
// Implements cache-first strategy for offline functionality
// Based on Create React App's workbox service worker pattern

const CACHE_NAME = 'thrust-monitor-v8';

console.log('[ServiceWorker] ‚ö° Loading service worker V8 (cache-first)...');
...
```

**Good!** Figma Make is serving the file. The issue is with registration.

### ‚ùå If you see 404 or error:
The file is **NOT being served** by Figma Make.

**This means:**
- Figma Make's preview doesn't serve files from `/public`
- We need a different approach
- Service worker must be generated dynamically

---

## Next Steps Based on Result

### If file EXISTS (you see code):
Run this in console to test direct registration:

```javascript
// Test direct registration
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', {
  scope: '/',
  updateViaCache: 'none'
}).then(reg => {
  console.log('‚úÖ Manual registration worked!');
  console.log('Scope:', reg.scope);
  console.log('Active:', reg.active);
}).catch(err => {
  console.error('‚ùå Manual registration failed:', err);
});
```

### If file DOESN'T EXIST (404):
Figma Make doesn't serve `/public` files in preview.

**Solution:** We need to generate the service worker dynamically and inject it into the page.

## Current Status

After hard refresh, check console for:

```

**Then one of:**

The error message will tell us exactly what's wrong!
