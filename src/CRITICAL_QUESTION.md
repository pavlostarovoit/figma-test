# üö® CRITICAL QUESTION - How Does Your Working Example Work?

## What We Know

**Your working Figma Make project:**
- ‚úÖ Has a service worker that works
- ‚úÖ Uses this code in `sw.js` (or `service-worker.js`):

```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = 'thrust-monitor-v1';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  '/App.tsx',
  '/styles/globals.css'
];

// ... rest of the code you showed me
```

**This project:**
- ‚ùå Gets 404 when trying to load `/service-worker.js`
- ‚ùå File exists in `/public/service-worker.js` but isn't served

## THE CRITICAL QUESTION

**In your working Figma Make project, where is the service worker file located?**

### Option A: In `/public` folder
```
/public/service-worker.js  ‚Üê Same as this project
```

### Option B: In root folder
```
/service-worker.js  ‚Üê Different location
```

### Option C: In a different folder
```
/sw.js
/worker/service-worker.js
/assets/service-worker.js
‚Üê Some other location
```

### Option D: Inline/generated
```javascript
// Maybe created dynamically in code?
const swCode = `...`;
const blob = new Blob([swCode]);
// etc
```

## What To Check

**In your working Figma Make project:**

1. **Open the file structure** (left sidebar in Figma Make)
2. **Look for the service worker file**
3. **Tell me the EXACT path** where it's located

**For example:**
- ‚úÖ "It's at `/service-worker.js` in the root"
- ‚úÖ "It's at `/public/sw.js`"
- ‚úÖ "It's at `/src/service-worker.js`"
- ‚úÖ "I don't see a file - it might be generated in code"

## Why This Matters

**The 404 error means:**
```
Browser: "Give me /service-worker.js"
Figma Server: "I don't have that file" (404)
```

**But your working project doesn't get 404, so either:**
1. The file is in a different location that Figma DOES serve
2. The registration method is different
3. The file is generated/inlined in code

## What To Do

**Please check your working project and tell me:**

1. **File location:** Where is the service worker file?
2. **File name:** What is it called exactly?
3. **Registration code:** How do you register it?

**Example registration code to look for:**
```javascript
// Might be in App.tsx or index.tsx
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
// or
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
// or
navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js')
// or something else?
```

## Once You Tell Me

Once I know **exactly** how your working project is structured, I can replicate that structure here and it will work! ‚úÖ

---

**PLEASE CHECK NOW:**
1. Open your working Figma Make project
2. Look at file structure
3. Find service worker file location
4. Tell me the exact path
5. Show me how it's registered

This is the key to making it work! üîë
