# 🚀 Rocket Engine Thrust Monitor - Offline Fixed!

## ✅ Traditional Service Worker - Cache-First Strategy

Your PWA uses `/public/service-worker.js` with **cache-first** strategy!

### What's Implemented

- ✅ **Traditional service worker** - Served from `/public/service-worker.js`
- ✅ **Cache-first loading** - Checks cache BEFORE network (instant offline)
- ✅ **Automatic caching** - All assets cached as you browse
- ✅ **V8 with cache-first** - Latest version optimized for offline
- ✅ **Offline indicator** - Orange banner when running from cache

### Why Not Blob URLs?

Attempted inline service worker (blob URLs) but browsers **don't support** blob URLs for service workers. Traditional approach works perfectly in Figma Make!

## 🎯 Quick Test (1 Minute)

### ⚠️ STEP 0: Hard Refresh First!

**Figma Make caches JavaScript. You MUST hard refresh to get new code:**

**Windows/Linux:** Ctrl + Shift + R
**Mac:** Cmd + Shift + R

### Step 1: Clear old data

**Open console (F12) and run:**

```javascript
offline.clearAll()
```
*Wait for automatic reload (2 seconds)*

### Step 2: Verify V8 is running

After reload, **scroll up in console** and look for:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
[PWA] 🚀 STARTING PWA INIT - SERVICE WORKER V8
═══════════════════════════════════════
[ServiceWorker] ⚡ Loading service worker V8 (cache-first)...
[ServiceWorker] ⬇️ Installing V8...
[ServiceWorker] ✅ Activating V8...
```

**✅ If you see "V8":** New code is running! Continue to Step 3.

**❌ If you see "V6" or "V7":** Old code still cached!
- Hard refresh again (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Or: F12 → Network → Check "Disable cache"
- Run `offline.clearAll()` again

### Step 3: Check status

Wait 10 seconds, then:
```javascript
offline.diagnostic()
```
*Should say: "✅ PWA is ready for offline mode!"*

### Step 4: Test offline

- F12 → Network → Offline → Reload
- Should load with orange banner! ✅

## 📖 Detailed Testing

**For complete testing instructions:**
- `/OFFLINE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide
- Console: `offline.help()` - Available commands

## 🔧 Console Commands

All available in browser console:

```javascript
offline.clearAll()          // Clear everything and reload
offline.diagnostic()        // Full status check
offline.checkCache()        // View cached files
offline.checkServiceWorker()// Check SW status
offline.forceUpdate()       // Force SW update
offline.help()              // Show all commands
```

## 📱 Installation

After verifying offline works, install on your device:

### Android (Chrome/Edge)
- Tap "Install" when prompted
- Or: Menu (⋮) → Install app

### iOS (Safari)
- Tap Share (⬆️) → Add to Home Screen

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge)
- Click install icon in address bar

## 🎓 How It Works

### Cache-First Strategy

**First visit (online):**
```
1. Service worker intercepts request
2. Checks cache → not found
3. Fetches from network
4. Caches response for next time
5. Returns to browser
```

**Next visit (online or offline):**
```
1. Service worker intercepts request
2. Checks cache → ✅ found!
3. Returns cached version immediately (instant!)
4. Updates cache in background
```

### What Gets Cached

- ✅ HTML pages
- ✅ JavaScript bundles
- ✅ CSS stylesheets
- ✅ Fonts (Noto Sans)
- ✅ Images and SVGs
- ❌ API calls to 192.168.4.1 (never cached)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **First visit must be online** - Cache needs to be built
2. **Wait 10 seconds** after first visit for caching
3. **Clear old service workers** before testing (use `offline.clearAll()`)
4. **Test in DevTools first** - Easier than toggling WiFi

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Page won't load offline

**Check cache:**
```javascript
offline.checkCache()
```

**If 0 files:**
- Weren't online during first visit
- Didn't wait long enough
- Run `offline.clearAll()` and try again

### Service worker not working

**Check status:**
```javascript
offline.checkServiceWorker()
```

**If not registered:**
- Clear and reload: `offline.clearAll()`
- Make sure on HTTPS or localhost

### Orange banner doesn't appear

**This is normal if:**
- Service worker hasn't activated (reload page)
- You're actually online (check WiFi)

**Check controller:**
```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.controller
  ? console.log('✅ Active')
  : console.log('❌ Reload needed')
```
