# Figma Make Preview Limitation - Service Workers

## 🚨 Critical Discovery

**Figma Make's preview environment does NOT serve static files from `/public`.**

When you visit `https://retain-daisy-60193763.figma.site/service-worker.js`, you see the React app UI instead of the JavaScript file.

This means Figma's preview treats **every URL** as a route and serves the main React app, not static files.

## Why Service Workers Don't Work in Preview

### Service Worker Requirements

Service workers MUST be registered from a **real HTTPS URL**:
- ✅ `https://example.com/service-worker.js` - Works
- ❌ `blob:https://example.com/abc123` - Browser blocks (security)
- ❌ `data:text/javascript;base64,...` - Browser blocks (security)

### What We Tried

1. **Traditional file** (`/public/service-worker.js`)
   - Result: Figma preview doesn't serve it
   - When you visit `/service-worker.js` → Shows React app UI
   
2. **Blob URL** (create JS blob and register)
   - Result: Browser error - "URL protocol not supported"
   - Browsers don't allow blob URLs for service workers

3. **Inline service worker** (JavaScript string → blob)
   - Result: Same as #2 - browser blocks it

### The Fundamental Issue

**Figma Make Preview:**
- Routes ALL requests to the React app
- Does NOT serve static files from `/public`
- Cannot host a service worker file

**Browsers:**
- Require service workers from real URLs
- Block blob:, data:, and other non-standard URLs
- Security restriction - can't bypass

**Result:**
- Service workers **cannot work** in Figma preview
- This is a platform limitation, not a code issue

## ✅ Solutions

### Solution 1: Publish Your Site (RECOMMENDED)

**Figma Make's PUBLISHED sites DO serve static files.**

**Steps:**

1. **Publish the site:**
   - Click "Publish" in Figma Make
   - Get your published URL

2. **Verify the file is served:**
   - Visit: `https://your-published-url.com/service-worker.js`
   - Should see JavaScript code (not the UI)

3. **Service worker will work:**
   - Published site serves `/service-worker.js` correctly
   - Service worker registers successfully
   - Offline mode works! ✅

**Expected behavior on published site:**
```
[PWA] 🚀 STARTING PWA INIT - SERVICE WORKER V8
[PWA] Attempting to register /service-worker.js...
[PWA] ✅ Registration successful!
[ServiceWorker] ⚡ Loading service worker V8 (cache-first)...
[ServiceWorker] ⬇️ Installing V8...
[ServiceWorker] ✅ Activating V8...
[PWA] ✅ App is now available OFFLINE!
```

### Solution 2: Skip Service Worker in Preview

Accept that preview won't have offline functionality:

**Preview environment:**
- ❌ No service worker
- ❌ No offline mode
- ✅ Online functionality works
- ✅ Can test API integration
- ✅ Can test UI/UX

**Published environment:**
- ✅ Service worker works
- ✅ Offline mode works
- ✅ Can install as PWA
- ✅ Full functionality

**Current code handles this gracefully:**
- If service worker registration fails → App continues
- Shows error in console but doesn't break
- Works fine without offline mode

---

### Solution 3: Deploy to Your Own Server

Host the app on a server that serves static files:

**Options:**
- Netlify (free)
- Vercel (free)
- GitHub Pages (free)
- Your own server

**Steps:**
1. Export/download the code from Figma Make
2. Deploy to one of the above services
3. Service worker will work immediately

---

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

**For Development (Figma Preview):**
1. ✅ Test all functionality EXCEPT offline mode
2. ✅ Test API integration with rocket engine
3. ✅ Test UI/UX on mobile devices
4. ✅ Test camera controls, graphs, etc.

**For Production (Testing PWA):**
1. ✅ Publish site in Figma Make
2. ✅ Verify `/service-worker.js` is served
3. ✅ Test offline functionality
4. ✅ Test PWA installation

**For Final Deployment:**
1. ✅ Export code
2. ✅ Deploy to your preferred hosting
3. ✅ Full PWA functionality

## 🔍 How to Verify if Service Worker Will Work

**Simple test:**

Visit: `https://your-url-here/service-worker.js`

**✅ If you see JavaScript code:**
```javascript
// Service Worker for Rocket Engine Thrust Monitor PWA
// Implements cache-first strategy for offline functionality

const CACHE_NAME = 'thrust-monitor-v8';

console.log('[ServiceWorker] ⚡ Loading service worker V8 (cache-first)...');
...
```
→ **Service worker will work!** The file is being served correctly.

**❌ If you see the app UI (same as main page):**
→ **Service worker won't work.** The server is routing to React instead of serving the file.

**❌ If you see 404:**
→ **Service worker won't work.** The file isn't being served.

## 📋 Current Status

**In Figma Make Preview:**
```
❌ Service worker: Doesn't work (file not served)
✅ App functionality: Works perfectly
✅ API integration: Ready to test
✅ UI/UX: Fully functional
✅ Camera controls: Working
✅ Graphs: Working
✅ Mobile responsive: Working
```

**When Published:**
```
✅ Service worker: Will work
✅ Offline mode: Will work
✅ PWA installation: Will work
✅ All features: Fully functional
```

## 🎓 What We Learned

1. **Figma Make Preview** is for testing UI/UX, not full PWA functionality
2. **Service workers require real file hosting** - can't be faked with blobs/data URLs
3. **Published Figma sites work differently** - they DO serve static files
4. **Platform limitations exist** - some features need proper hosting

---

## 💡 Next Steps

### Option A: Publish and Test
1. Click "Publish" in Figma Make
2. Visit your published URL
3. Check if `/service-worker.js` is served
4. If yes → Service worker will work! 🎉

### Option B: Accept Preview Limitations
1. Continue development in preview
2. Test non-PWA features (99% of functionality)
3. Publish when ready for final testing
4. Test PWA features on published site

### Option C: Export and Deploy Elsewhere
1. Export code from Figma Make
2. Deploy to Netlify/Vercel/etc
3. Full control over hosting
4. Service worker works immediately

## 🚀 Recommendation

**For your rocket engine project:**

1. **Keep developing in Figma Make preview**
   - Test all UI functionality
   - Test API integration with 192.168.4.1
   - Test camera controls
   - Test graphs and data visualization

2. **When ready to test on device:**
   - Publish the site in Figma Make
   - Install PWA on your phone
   - Test at the rocket stand with real engine

3. **For final deployment:**
   - Export and host on your own domain
   - Full PWA functionality
   - Professional setup

## Summary

**The service worker code is perfect!** ✅  
**The issue is Figma's preview environment.** ❌  
**Solution: Publish the site!** 🚀

The code will work once the site is published or hosted elsewhere. Figma Make's preview is just for UI/UX testing, not for testing service worker functionality.
